# Installing hoppie-sasl
## Installation from source
The repository for hoppie-sasl contains the code used, but does not contain the libraries required for running it with x-plane. As a result, some simple installation is required:

* Grab the latest SASL v3 from http://1-sim.com/files/SASL-v3.zip
* Extract this to ``X-Plane/Resources/plugins/hoppie-sasl/``, ensuring you have the path ``X-Plane/Resources/plugins/hoppie-sasl/64/win.xpl``
* Download the hoppie-sasl repository as a zip, and extract it to ``X-Plane/Resources/plugins/hoppie-sasl/data/modules/``, ensuring you have the path ``X-Plane/Resources/plugins/hoppie-sasl/data/modules/main.lua``
